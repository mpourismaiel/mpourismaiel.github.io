# Portfolio

My overengineered portfolio website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

No point in adding usage instructions, if you want to run this locally, you know what you're doing. If you find any issues, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
